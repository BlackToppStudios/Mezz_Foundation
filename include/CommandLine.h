/// @brief A collection of arguments and possible associated flags.
/// @details This is a simple container for storing command line arguments after parsing them in an opinionated but
/// common way.

/// This accepts the Argument Count (commonly argc) and Argument Vector/Values(argv) in the constructor as they are
/// passed into main.
/// @code{.cpp}
/// int main(int ArgC, char** ArgV)
/// {
///      const CommandLineArguments Parsed(ArgC, ArgV);
/// @endcode
/// After this the instannce of CommandLineArguments has only readable members, every member is const and nothing is
/// mutable. This is to insure that accidents cause compilation errors and allows confidence that use of this that
/// compile are likely to be correct (or at least only wrong because of runtime logic errors like indexing errors).
/// @n @n
/// This tries to look a little like typical GNU command line arguments. This handles "long"
/// arguments that start with "--" like "--all" and this handles "short" arguments that start with "-" like "-a and
/// combined short forms like "-rf".
/// @n @n
/// This also handles arguments without a "-" prefix by presuming they are parameters for previous arguments. Many
/// arguments need additional information to specify some behavior. Consider a potential zip command, it might accept a
/// "--file" flag to indicate the name of the zip file to work with. This could parse this syntax like this
/// "myZipCommand --file fileToWork.zip".
/// @n @n
/// This makes no further guarantees about preserving the order arguments are passed in. For example "-wtf" is the same
/// as "-tfw" are treated the same as long as there are no trailing parameters for those arguments.
/// @n @n
/// This converts all arguments to keys in a map with a value of a vector of their parameters. Consider this command:
/// @code
///     foo.exe -s
/// @endcode
///
/// This would store "foo.exe" in the data member ExecutableCommand and turns the arg into a dictionary with one key,
/// "-s", and that key would have an empty vector for a value. As an std::initializer_list it might look like:
/// @code
///     { {"-s", {} }
/// @endcode
///
/// The following examples have the same executable command and but would make slightly different data structures and
/// are illustrated as possible initializer lists:
/// @n @n
///
/// Short arguments are broken up, and long arguments are not. Short arguments have one ArgToken ("-"), long have two
/// ArgTokens. Consider this example:
/// @code
///    foo.exe -sf --long
/// @endcode
///
/// Which would yield a structure like the following when parsed with this:
/// @code
///     {
///         { "--long", {} },
///         { "-s",     {} },
///         { "-w",     {} }
///     }
/// @endcode
///
/// Here are some of the things you can do with this parsed structure:
/// @code{.cpp}
/// int main(int ArgC, char** ArgV)
/// {
///      const CommandLineArguments Parsed(ArgC, ArgV);
///      std::cout
///         << Parsed.ExecutableCommand // foo.exe
///         << Parsed.Arguments.at("--long").size() // 0 but it does exist so no exception from #at.
///         << Parsed.Arguments.contains("-s"); // true
/// @endcode
///
/// Items following arguments with not "-" are treating as parameters to the argument they follow. These examples will
/// use this command line:
/// @code
///    foo.exe -s --long trailing -w trailing_short
/// @endcode
///
/// In the produced data structure each arugument is paired with a collection of its parameters. He we can see that
/// "trailing" in a collection attached to "--long" and "trailing_short" is attached to "-s":
///
/// @code
///     {
///         { "-s",     {} },
///         { "--long", {"trailing"} },
///         { "-w",     {"trailing_short"} }
///     }
/// @endcode
/// These are store as vector like objects in the structure that is produced after parsing. These can be referenced
/// by operator[] or the #at member function like in the following example:
///
/// @code{.cpp}
/// int main(int ArgC, char** ArgV)
/// {
///      const CommandLineArguments Parsed(ArgC, ArgV);
///      std::cout
///         << Parsed.Arguments.at("--long").at(0) // trailing
///         << Parsed.Arguments.at("-w").at(0); // trailing_short
/// @endcode
///
/// Multiple arguments of the same name are mapped onto the same key, so this command line with 6 short argument is
/// actually mapped onto a parsed structure with 5 because "-b" is entered twice:
/// @code
///    foo.exe -wtfbbq
/// @endcode
///
/// Here we can see that there is no way to no about the duplicate "-b"
/// @code
///     {
///         { "-w",     {} },
///         { "-t",     {} },
///         { "-f",     {} },
///         { "-b",     {} },
///         { "-q",     {} }
///     }
/// @endcode
///
/// If you pass multiple arguments with "-" they keeping appending to that vector in the resulting map even if that
/// argument is passed multiple times on the command line:
/// @code
///     foo.exe -a arg1 -pa arg2 arg3 -x arg4
/// @endcode
///
/// Because the same name is "-a" is used multiple times it get arg1, arg2, and arg3:

///     {
///         { "-a", {"arg1", "arg2", "arg3"} },
