/// This also handles arguments without a "-" prefix by presuming they are parameters for previous arguments. Many
/// arguments need additional information to specify some behavior. Consider a potential zip command, it might accept a

/// @n @n
///     foo.exe -s

/// This would store "foo.exe" in the data member ExecutableCommand and turns the arg into a dictionary with one key,
