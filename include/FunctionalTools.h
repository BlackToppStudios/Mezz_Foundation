/// @page FuncionalTools Funcional Tools
/// Functional programming is all the craze in many circles. There are places where it can be useful, even in game
/// development, but it isn't a magical panacea as some treat it. Specifically, it is great for data transformations
/// that aren't sensitive to a specific kind of performance. Functional designs can often get good bandwidth or good
/// latency but rarely both. The mechanisms for optimizing one way or the other are often buried deep in the functional
/// language or toolset, this has the nice effect of concealing a great deal of complexity allowing the developer to
/// focus on solving a problem. These tools are no different, it is designed for high bandwidth and ease of use. Code
/// built using imperative, procedural, or Object Oriented(OOP) methods would be much larger and complex but would allow
/// the developer using them to readily design for good latency or good bandwidth. This being a game development suite
/// is designed for an optimal mix of these depending on where the code goes. The Mezzanine like all game dev tools aims
/// for optimal per frame latency (FPS!) and as much bandwidth (How many triangles, sprites, filters in the game state).
/// This means there are places typical functional designs are poorly suited, such as the hot path or working with
/// hetergenous data needing complex manipulation and having side effects. There are places functional design is ideal
/// for because the game dev tool is imperfect such as creating tools, servers, and places where correctness and
/// rapidity of development is more important than rapidity of execution.
/// @n @n
/// @section FunctionToolsIntroToFP Intro to Functional Programming
/// For those not familar Functional Programming is a software developement paradign which focuses on manipulating
/// functions and parts of functions to create a different kind of abstraction from imperative or OOP designs. Rather
/// than creating new data structures or new algorithms a functional style focuses on manipulating re-usable components
/// of control flow. It can be used to create data structures or algorithmw but when doing this it is often implied in
/// the construction of containers and arrangement of functions.
/// @n @n
/// There are common things you might see in various programming paradigms. Or at least this how Sqeaky thinks a
/// comparison of these paradigms might be useful to people familar with OOP/Imperative and trying a Functional
/// paradigm for the first time:
/// @n
///   - Imperative/Procedural,
///     - Code Reuse,
///       - Functions are used for code reuse by calling with different parameters,
///       - Few mechanisms for older code to invoke newer code,
///
///     - Control Flow,
///       - Plenty of explicit control flow: Loops, Counters, Ifs, Switches,
///       - Control flow at the low and high level is usually obvious and usually conceptually linear,
///       - Not many ways to create new control flow,
///       - Application call graphs are likely cleanly hierarchical but difficult to change,
///
///     - Data Structures,
///       - Structured data held in structs and managed with pointers/references to make trees/lists/graphs,
///       - Data is generally mutable and controlling what can change it might be challenging,
///       - Data layout can (must?) be precisely controlled and is often optimized for size of speed,
///
///     - Reasoning About Code,
///       - Function side effects, like global state mutations, are common,
///       - Higher level abstractions not need or useful to consider application flow,
///
///     - Threading,
///       - Systems are often older and not multithreaded, threading mechanism when present are often simple.
///       - When present bugs tend to be numerous.
/// @n
///   - Object Oriented Programming (OOP)
///     - Code Reuse,
///       - Functions and objects are used for code reuse by changing parameters,
///       - Attaching functions on objects as parameters allows old code to call new code using runtime polymorphism,
///
///     - Control Flow,
///       - Plenty of explicit control flow: Loops, Counters, Ifs,
///       - Some switches replaced by inheritance and code snippets can be smaller and more maintainable,
///       - Control flow is obvious at low level in each object or function,
///       - Creation of new control flow can be created but generally treated as major efforts (DI, ECS),
///       - Control flow can be masked at higher conceptual levels by polymorphism or dependency injection,
///       - Application call graphs are likely cleanly hierarchical until inheritance is involved,
///
///     - Data Structures,
///       - Data layout can be explicit or implicit in objects,
///       - Data is often mutable and access is usually controlled by scope and encapsulation,
///       - Controlling (or not controlling) data layout generally very easy,
///
///     - Reasoning About Code,
///       - Functions often have side effects scoped to one object, class, or module,
///       - Classes considered in isolation are often simple to reason about,
///       - If inheritance is abused reasoning is impossible (Just keep your class heirachies small),
///       - Dependency injection containers and Entity Component Systems are used explicitly where reasoning is hard,
///
///     - Threading,
///       - System might be old or modern and may have a variety of threading models,
///       - Classes exist to manage threading primitives Threads, Mutexes, ThreadingPools, Atomic Variables, et al,
///       - When present bugs tend to be numerous.
/// @n
///   - Functional Programming (FP)
///     - Code Reuse,
///       - Functions can be reused by composing them into new functions or changing parameters,
///       - Functions commonly used as parameters heavily encourages direct reuse of older code,
///
///     - Control Flow,
///       - Little explicit control flow, lambdas, recursion, and lazy evaluation masks control flow,
///       - Control flow might be heavily masked by Lazy Evaluation, Currying, partial function application, et al,
///       - New control flow can be created with new functions,
///
///     - Data Structures,
///       - The specific structure of data is often an afterthought and some effort required to manage layout,
///       - Data is generally immutable and mutability simulated by copying data,
///
///     - Reasoning About Code,
///       - Functions rarely have side effects and can generally be used in new contexts without prior review,
///       - Results and type of transformation replace normal paradigms of control flow,
///       - Trying to consider application at once is often difficult,
///
///     - Threading,
///       - Systems likely to be newer and very thread friendly because of immutability and lack of preconditions
///       - Trivial to add threading correctly, often used to make up for suboptimal performance designs.
///
/// @n @n
/// These are just some heuristics, not every system matches all or any of these. Each paradign has pros and cons,
/// and C++ can do all three, but needs some tooling to do FP comfortably.
/// @n @n
/// In C++20 we will be getting a big upgrade to ranges, which is a latency optimized design based on iterators and lazy
/// evaluation. This design is great because if results are discard they are never computed, it doesn't make copies,
/// and allows for mutable or immutable functions. This design is bad because allow mutabilty has concurrency
/// implications and creating new functions to operate with ranges is complex and has tight preconditions.
/// @n @n
/// We wanted tools now, and tools that would be useful alongside or in additional to these tool so we made a different
/// design.
/// @n @n
/// @section FunctionToolsInTheMezzanine FP in the Mezzanine
/// The Mezzanine has some solid solutions to some of the problems discussed here already, and game development has
/// tight constraints on performance and data. Because of these constraints it is unlikely that FP will be used on
/// performance critical paths directly in games, and those tools in the hot path are less useful in general contexts.
/// FP does have plenty of uses in tooling, non-optimized paths, and places where it performs well.
/// @n @n
/// These tools generally operate on const references and make no attempt to perform lazy evaluation. This means there
/// will be a huge amount of copies, tools like C++20 ranges may be more applicable on heavyweight classes. Other than
/// operating on immutable data there are no specific attempts to integrate threading (This is likely to change with
/// Mezz_Threading). These design decisions were made to maximize simplicity and attempt to fit the problem space poorly
/// addressed elsewhere in the Mezzanine.
/// @n @n
/// Mezzanine::Functional provides 4 categories of components:
/// @n
///   - @ref FuncionalToolsThePipe, a tool for connecting Functors,
///   - An assortment of @ref FuncionalToolsFunctors that operate on containers and return containers,
///   - A few special purpose functions for getting data by using @ref FuncionalToolsDrains,
///   - A few @ref FuncionalToolsExtras that smooth out functional interaction.
/// @n @n
/// Some of these components are useful on their own, but the primary design pattern introduced is
/// @ref FunctionalToolsPipeFunctorDrainPattern .
/// The Functors can all be used on their own and encapsulate one little piece of control flow. Individually, they can
/// copy data into new containers, apply different changes, or select only specific portion of the data. Just using one
/// at a time the can seem simplistic, alone these can be seen as just a layer over many of the standard library
/// functions or simple pieces of control flow that might be a loop and an if. As syntactic sugar these might be nice
/// but not compelling.
/// @n
/// Through chaining several functor together they can allow incredibly nuanced and sophisted data manipulation with
/// minimal complexity. The functors can be nested in code just like normal function calls, but by starting with a pipe
/// chaining them can be streamlined. Through pipes counting parentheses and tracking large amounts of parameters should
/// be reduced.
///
/// @subsection FuncionalToolsThePipe The Pipe
/// todo
///
/// operator>> accepts a functor and returns a pipe with the data.
///
/// operator> accepts a function and returns the data, effectively terminating the pipe.
///
///
/// @subsection FuncionalToolsFunctors Included Functors
/// There are a collection of functions that operate on containers and return a container. All of the provided functors
/// provide a similar interface and similar set of operations. They all accept a container by const reference. They all
/// accept either data or a predicate. If they accept a predicate it will generally be applied to each member of the
/// input (invoked once for each item in the input passing that item to it). All of these functors can also accept
/// the return container type.
/// @n @n
/// All of the functors support direct invocation. if passed all the arguments they will perform the operation
/// immediately:
/// @code
/// auto SomeFreshContainer = Functor(Data, PredicateOrArgument);
/// @endcode
/// @n @n
/// All of the functors suport automatic currying of predicates. Currying is creating a new function by pre-filling some
/// of the parameters with some value and getting a new function. This as a concept can be alien to experienced
/// Imperative and OOP developers and some terms to research include "function currying",
/// "partial function application", and "std::bind". This is easy enough to use:
/// @code
/// auto SomeFreshFunction = Functor(PredicateOrArgument);
/// auto SomeFreshContainer = Functor(Data);
/// @endcode
/// @n @n
/// All of these functors also support explicit specification of return type. Internally they all operating on iterator
/// pairs and don't much care about the details of the output container. Be careful with this, it makes no sense to
/// sort or reverse a set. This works with immediately invoked or autocurrying forms of the functors:
/// @code
/// ContainerType SomeFreshContainer = Functor<ContainerType>(Data, PredicateOrArgument);
/// // Or
/// auto SomeFreshFunction = Functor<ContainerType>(PredicateOrArgument);
/// ContainerType SomeFreshContainer = Functor(Data);
/// @endcode
///
/// Here is a list of supplied functors that accept a container and return a container:
///
///     - @ref Convert - Apply the predicate to each item and return all the results.
///     - @ref DropBackN - Copy all the items except the last N, in reverse order
///     - @ref DropN - Skip the first N, then copy the rest.
///     - @ref DropBackWhile - Copy items from the back, but skip items while the predicate it true. Reverse order
///     - @ref DropWhile - Skip first items while predicate returns true, then copy the rest.
///     - @ref Filter - Alias for @ref Select .
///     - @ref Map - Alias for @ref Convert .
///     - @ref Reject - Copy All items that don't match a predicate.
///     - @ref Reverse - Return the continer in reverse order.
///     - @ref Select - Copy all items matching a predicate.
///     - @ref TakeBackN - Copy the last N items in reverse order.
///     - @ref TakeN - Copy the first N items.
///     - @ref TakeBackWhile - Copy from the back until the predicate returns false.
///     - @ref TakeWhile - Copy from the beginning until the predicate returns false in reverse order.
///     - @ref
///
/// Sort
/// Zip
/// Unzip
/// Compact - Drops nulls
/// Slice (int Start, int End)
/// Reverse
/// Unique
/// Shuffle
/// ForEach
/// Sample
/// Flatten - Will be difficult with type system.
/// Rotate
/// Partition
///
/// @subsection FuncionalToolsDrains Funtional Drains
///
/// Drain is a term invented by this library to discuss functor that are likely to end pipes. This functor behave like
/// the rest of the functors but in isolation would seem preposterously simple. These are often a simple member function
/// call on the container or a similar arrangement of parameters that would be simple to invoke alone. The exist to
/// round out the API that the @ref Pipe and @ref FuncionalToolsFunctors provide and may be less useful alone.
/// @n @n
/// Like the @ref FuncionalToolsFunctors these try to follow a similar pattern but cannot do so perfectly because of
/// implementation details. All of these return a single value (or pair or optional of the data) and not a normal
/// container of data. Many, but not all of these support automatic currying. Any that accept a predicate do support it,
/// but some, like size, do not. If called without data it returns a version of itself doesn't support auto-currying.
/// Many of these do not support declaring the return type because is it implied by the operation performa and there is
/// no expenseive copying operating that can be co-opted to change the container.
///
/// Here is a list of supported for getting a single value and potentially draining a @ref Pipe:
///
///     - @ref Accumulate - Get a single value by Folding over the container.
///     - @ref AllOf - Do all of the items match some predicate?
///     - @ref AnyOf - Do any of the data match a predicate?
///     - @ref Collect - An alias for @ref Accumulate .
///     - @ref Contains - Is there an item that matches the predicate?
///     - @ref LeftFold - An alias for @ref Accumulate .
///     - @ref Includes - An alias for @ref Contains .
///     - @ref IsPartitioned - Do all the true items come before false items according to a predicated?
///     - @ref IsSorted - Is the container sorted according to some predicate?
///     - @ref Length - An alias for @ref Size .
///     - @ref Max - Get the largest value in passed container.
///     - @ref Min - Get the minimum value from container
///     - @ref MinMax - In a single pass get the minimum and maximum values.
///     - @ref NoneOf - Do none of the data match a predicate?
///     - @ref Reduce - An alias for @ref Accumulate .
///     - @ref Size - Get the size of the input data.
