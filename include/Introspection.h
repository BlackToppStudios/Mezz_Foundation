    /// The Mezzanine Introspection system is a collection of Classes, Structs, and Functions that heavily
    /// leverage Template Meta-programming to allow generic code for the reading and writing of values on
    /// classes and/or structs. With the Introspection system it is possible to create as little as one
    /// function to perform the reading and/or writing of values of an arbitrary number of types, rather
    /// than creating one or more functions per type.
    /// @n @n
    /// This Introspection system could be considered a Reflection system and many people do call similar
    /// systems Reflection systems, but we have opted (perhaps incorrectly) to call this an Introspection
    /// system because we felt it was closer to the generic computer science definition given on Wikipedia.
    /// Specifically that
    /// <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_introspection">Introspection</a>
    /// involves the reading and detection of members on an object (which this system does), while
    /// <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflection_(computer_programming)">Reflection</a>
    /// involves writing to those members as well as changes to composition and behavior of an object (this
    /// system only does writing from that list). That said, this is largely a semantics issue and it's
    /// reasonable to call this system either an Introspection or Reflection system.
    /// @n @n
    /// The Introspection system utilizes many new features from c++17 and even one feature from
    /// c++20/the experimental namespace. These features are primarily std::string_view, std::is_detected,
    /// and fold expressions. If you aren't familiar with these then this system might be slightly more
    /// difficult to understand.
    /// @section IntrospectImplement Implementation
    /// In this section we'll attempt to explain the code, what it does where it's not obvious, and how
    /// the code interacts with other code where applicable. It may not be intuitive, but we'll start

    /// The MemberAccessor is a class that stores the means of...accessing...a member. Deeply Complicated.
    /// It actually kinda is, but only a little. The MemberAccessor contains only 3 members, two member
    /// pointers and a string view.
    /// @n @n
    /// The pointers are template parameters that are checked with static_asserts to make sure they are
    /// pointers, but they can be direct to member pointers or pointers to member functions. The only types
    /// that are not allowed are normal C-arrays. std::array is fine though. The supported function signatures
    /// vary in order to accommodate as many configurations as possible.
    /// @n @n
    /// Setter signatures supported:
    /// @code
    /// void (T::*)(const Member&)  // Set by const reference
    /// void (T::*)(const Member)   // Set by const value
    /// void (T::*)(Member&&)       // Set by rvalue/move reference

    /// are SFINAE enabled constructors and support functions you can use that accept 2 parameters instead of the
    /// usual 3, allowing you to avoid passing in a duplicate of the same parameter and makes construction cleaner.
    /// @n @n
    /// An important note about the Set and Get access pointers is that they can be direct to member or pointers
    /// to member functions that set and/or get the member value. If you are concerned about memory footprint then
    /// you should strongly consider using direct to member pointers over member function pointers. We've tested

    /// one direct to member pointer and one member function pointer for the setter and getter then you'd get a
    /// MemberAccessor that is 40 bytes on both platforms. Curiously, we also tested MSVC 19.14 (through wine)

    /// functions or pointers to members) will simply fail to compile. You are limited to the public interface.
    /// Second, due to limitations imposed by Argument-Dependent Lookup(ADL) any such function needs to be
    /// declared in the same scope as the base function being specialized from. This means any such function must
    /// be located in the root Mezzanine namespace.
    /// @n @n
    /// In exchange for these caveats you get a pretty powerful feature; the ability to register a class for
    /// Introspection without altering it whatsoever. So if you have code you aren't responsible for or otherwise
    /// cannot alter you can use this approach to Introspect it without issue. You could even make a registration
    /// function for the MemberAccessor class (why? please no) for no reason!
    /// @n @n
    /// The two static member functions are essentially identical in every way other than name. RegisterMembers
    /// is the more correct/consistent name and GetSerializableMembers is more consistent (somewhat) with older
    /// legacy code in the Mezzanine engine. Otherwise they are the same. So going forward examples will use the
    /// RegisterMembers name. Speaking of, lets take a look at an implementation example.
    /// @code
    /// struct MyVector3

    ///             MakeMemberAccessor("Z",&MyVector3::Z)
    ///         );
    ///     }
    /// };
    /// @endcode
    /// The "Members" function is something we haven't covered before. Members is a simple wrapper around
    /// std::make_tuple but with a more appropriate name. You can safely imagine Members to instead read
    /// "std::make_tuple" and that would be correct. Inside that call, we're making a MemberAccessor for each of
    /// our 3 members; X, Y, and Z. Each MemberAccessor is made without any MemberTags and using a direct to

    /// of these kinds of developers, skip to the next section.
    /// @n @n
    /// All of the functions in the Introspection system that operate on members of classes go through 2 functions
    /// (in the IntrospectionHelpers namespace) to do so generically; @ref TupleForEach and @ref TupleForEachIdx.
    /// TupleForEach is overloaded to have 2 versions, one of which is a no-op if the tuple parameter is empty. This
    /// overload exists to help ease template generation. TupleForEachIdx does the actual leg work. Here's the actual
    /// code as of the time of this writing:
    /// @code
    /// template<typename Funct, typename... Members, size_t... Idxs>
    /// constexpr void TupleForEachIdx(Funct&& ToCall,const std::tuple<Members...>& Mems,std::index_sequence<Idxs...>)

    ///     { (void)ToCall;  (void)Mems; }
    /// @endcode
    /// Functions in the public part of the Introspection API that interact with MemberAccessors will call TupleForEach
    /// passing in the function (or lambda) to be invoked with the member, and a tuple of the MemberAccessors for a
    /// given class. It is expected a specific instance of the class will be referenced in the function, which we will
    /// cover in more detail later.
    /// @n @n
    /// In the event that the tuple is empty (which implies an error) then the no-op overload will be called and
    /// nothing will happen. The function will simply return. If TupleForEach were ever called with an unregistered
    /// class then the no-op overload would be selected, because the fallback RegisterMembers<T> function is always
    /// used when a specialization isn't found. If you think the Introspection system is doing nothing when it should
    /// instead be doing nothing, check to see if a class is registered.
    /// @n @n
    /// If a valid tuple is passed into TupleForEach, the top overload is selected. This method is just an indirect
    /// for generating an index sequence from the deduced tuple members. This index sequence, the tuple, and a
    /// perfectly forwarded function is then passed into TupleForEachIdx, where the real magic happens.
    /// @n @n
    /// The big, big thing in the implementation of TupleForEachIdx is the fold expression. It is one line that gets
    /// expanded to either more than one line, or one super convoluted line, depending on how you think about it. In
    /// case you aren't familiar with fold expressions, the short explanation is that they will unwrap a parameter
    /// pack and generate one call of the logic per parameter unpacked with the provided operator between them. So if
    /// we assume the index sequence has <0,1,2> as it's template parameters then the generated code would look
    /// something like this:
    /// @code
    /// // Super convoluted code
    /// ( ( ( ToCall(std::get<0>(Mems)) ) , ToCall(std::get<1>(Mems)) ) , ToCall(std::get<2>(Mems)) );
    /// //                                ^ provided operator           ^ provided operator
    /// @endcode
    /// Because of operator precedence, the std::get<0> is called first and passed into our function/lambda. The comma
    /// operator in c++ simply means that both are evaluated and then the left hand result is discarded. In this case
    /// Funct is expected to be a type without a return type anyway so we're not losing anything. But we get to use
    /// the syntax of a fold expression to get it to generate the calls we need based on the index sequence. So the
    /// first call gets it's non-existent return discarded and then std::get<1> gets called and is passed our
    /// function/lambda, then it's result is discarded and finally std::get<2> is called and passed into our
    /// function/lambda. All of this is functionally equivalent to:
    /// @code
    /// // Much more readable
    /// ( ToCall(std::get<0>) );
    /// ( ToCall(std::get<1>) );
    /// ( ToCall(std::get<2>) );
    /// @endcode
    /// All of this works with index sequences of arbitrary size, which allows us to handle classes with arbitrary
    /// numbers of members in them. This does put some limitations on how some of these lambdas are written, which
    /// we'll cover in more detail later. These limitations are reasonably manageable though.
    /// @n @n
    /// So we're not actually looping over all of the members in a given class. Since we know the members of a given
    /// class at compile time and that can't change, we can just use template meta-magic to generate us a call per
    /// member. Combined with a lambda that accepts a single "auto" parameter we can get away with and and every
    /// member a class could have. Keep in mind that the MemberAccessor for the member is being passed in here, not
    /// the member itself. We couldn't have the member itself at this stage since we lack an actual instance of the
    /// object in these functions.
    /// @subsection IntrospectQuery Checks and Querying
    /// The Introspection system contains a few utility methods for the querying of types registered. They are minor
    /// and few in number, but may prove useful in some contexts.
    /// @n @n
    /// The most important check is whether or not a class is even registered with the Introspection system. The
    /// function has this signature:
    /// @code
    /// template<typename Class>
    /// constexpr Boole IsRegistered()
    /// @endcode
    /// It's super simple. Just call it with the class you want to check and it'll return true or false. This function
    /// is useful for verifying some simple errors that may occur when using the Introspection system and it should
    /// be VERY fast, since virtually all (if not all) of the logic can be determined at compile time.
    /// @n @n
    /// Another useful check is to see whether or not a class has a specific member. The @ref HasMember function
    /// will check if a class has a member with the specified name. Here's its signature:
    /// @code
    /// template<typename Class>
    /// Boole HasMember(const StringView Name)
    /// @endcode
    /// It's important to note here that all string operations in the Introspection system are done with string views
    /// for performance. Care should be taken to ensure the string is valid during the entire lifetime of it's use in
    /// the Introspection system.
    /// @n @n
    /// A bit less useful, but may be of help in some edge cases is the ability to check how many registered members
    /// exist for a given class. For that we have the @ref GetMemberCount function. Here's the signature:
    /// @code
    /// template<typename Class>
    /// constexpr size_t GetMemberCount()
    /// @endcode
    /// Keep in mind that this will only return the number of members registered with the class, not an actual count
    /// in the class declaration. If this number seems wrong, then double check the class registration method to
    /// ensure it is emitting the members you want.
    /// @n @n
    /// The remaining functions to be covered in this section are simple functions that wrap in the internal
    /// counterparts to expose registered classes and members. @ref GetRegisteredName and @ref GetRegisteredMembers
    /// functions exist to do exactly that. They both have fall backs to return a non-initialized string view
    /// (GetRegisteredName) or an empty tuple (GetRegisteredMembers) in the event either is called with a class type
    /// that isn't registered. Here are their signatures:
    /// @code
    /// template<typename Class>
    /// constexpr StringView GetRegisteredName()
    ///
    /// template<typename Class>
    /// const auto& GetRegisteredMembers()
    /// @endcode
    /// Note that GetRegisteredMembers returns a const reference, rather than a copy. All functions on the
    /// MemberAccessor are const anyway, but in case you are going to do some template meta programming with the return
    /// types you'll have to use the class registration function directly.
    /// @subsection IntrospectDoFor Operating on Data
    /// All of this would be very limited if we weren't able to insert custom logic to run based on the registered
    /// members of a given class. There are two methods that will accept a lambda to be call for each member being
    /// worked on. @ref DoForAllMembers will invoke the lambda for every member on the class and @ref DoForMember will
    /// invoke for only the named Member(s). In general, you should make every member name unique, but the system does
    /// not check for, nor enforce, uniqueness in member names whatsoever. It is up to you to disambiguate members
    /// with the same name if that occurs.
    /// @n @n
    /// There are a couple of requirements for using both functions, mostly regarding the lambdas. Any lambda created
    /// should not have a return. It shouldn't prevent compilation in there is a return statement, just the value
    /// returned won't go anywhere and will be discarded. Additionally, it should accept only one parameter with the
    /// type "const auto&". Simply "auto" should work as well. Auto is necessary because MemberAccessor types vary
    /// greatly and making it auto will permit the compiler to generate a lambda for each MemberAccessor in a type
    /// safe way. By now this should be obvious, but I'll state it anyway. The parameter passed into the lambda is NOT
    /// the Member or a copy of the member in anyway. It is an accessor to the member and you'll have to call the
    /// appropriate function on the MemberAccessor inside the lambda to work the with actual member.
    /// @n @n
    /// DoForAllMembers and DoForAllMembersReverse are overloaded functions with two versions each and use SFINAE to
    /// ensure only one each will be visible for a given class at a time based on whether or not it is registered.
    /// DoForAllMembers will go over each member in the order provided to the members tuple during registration.
    /// DoForAllMembersReverse will go over each member in the provided tuple in reverse order. Here's the signatures:

    ///
    /// template<typename Class, typename Funct, typename = std::enable_if_t<!IsRegistered<Class>()>, typename = void>

    /// @n @n

    /// @n @n
    /// GetMemberType has a couple minor caveats to keep in mind. First, it will create a temporary that is eventually
