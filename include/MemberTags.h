    // These tags are left over from a short-lived attempt at using tags as types for the metadata of individual
    // class members.  The idea being that there would be a third variadic template parameter for each created
    // member that contains all the tags appropriate for that member (most being empty) which would then get
    // stored in a tuple and (using) aliased on that member type.  That type could then be queried using the
    // type traits below (tuple_has_type) to generate custom behavior for specific types of data.
    // This system is unworkable because of the run-time polymorphic requirements of the serialization backends
    // that are planned for the system.  There is no way to pass around arbitrary and concrete types in a sane
    // manner through a virtual interface.  Furthermore, the likelihood that arbitrary tag types will be needed
    // is very low as it would require the user to write (or modify) their own serialization backends to leverage
    // the flexibility.  This is a significant coding burden that we shouldn't plan on as library maintainers.
    // For these reasons we've shelved explicit types as member tags in favor of an enum (MemberTags), despite
    // it's limitations, as we don't expect to be all that hindered by them in all but the most extreme use cases.
    // Should the run-time polymorphic requirement of the serialization system be lifted then it is possible that
    // some performance benefits could be gained by reverting to this approach to member tags.  That is why
    // this code is left commented and this documentation was written.
