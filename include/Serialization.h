// - Investigate the need to support c-string serialization.
// + Track serialized pointers to prevent loops/infinite recurrsion during serialization.
// + Investigate way to register pointer types to better check if pointers to different types in the inheritance heirarchy is pointing to the same object. (Pointer math with the RTTI pointer?)
// + Track and store objects with shared ownership.
// + Implement a way to generate/construct child objects for deserialization. ("Create" MemberTag value?)(Require default constructors for serialized types?)
// + Consider better methods of storing unique IDs of linked objects and methods of getting at them. (Maybe encourage more designs that only store the ID and fetch pointers per invocation)
// + Investigate templatizing the backend for a full template solution (instead of polymorphic backends).
// + Investigate the possibility of having a single versioned save/load function that calls the Serialize/Deserialize template specializations, allowing overloads at different levels.
