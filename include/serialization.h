    /// Serialization is the process of converting a class instance into a serial sequence of bits. DeSerialization is taking those
    /// bits and reconstructing the original object without losing anything of value (in theory the only things not saved are cached
    /// values or values calulated as they are needed). These bits could be just about anything, because of its ubiquity we chose
    /// to serialize to xml (or something so similar as to be indistinguishable from standard xml). This allows a wide variety of tools
    /// to be used when working with and verifying these serialized classes. Additionally, transmitting and storing xml is easy to do,
    /// and can be done with a variety of other factors in mind. The xml text can be sent down any stream, put in any file, compressed,
    /// queried. You should see @ref XMLManual for information about the xml system itself.

    /// @subsection serializationxml Serialization and XML
    /// The process of serializing doesn't just convert from class instance to text. Since our end goal is to convert live objects to
    /// XML it makes sense to closely integrate the Mezzanine::xml portion of the engine. If you plan on writing serialization
    /// and deserialization code you should read the following parts of the @ref XMLManual at a minimum:
    ///     - @ref XMLDOM
    ///     - @ref XMLAccessingBasics
    ///     - @ref XMLModifyingNodeData
    ///     - @ref XMLModifyingAttributeData
    ///
    /// The central object that will carry information during this process is the Mezzanine::XML::Node. The Mezzanine::XML::Node is an excellent
    /// tool for converting and storing data in a single unified heirarchy.
    /// \n \n
    /// C++ and most other object oriented languages heavily imply that class inheritance should be structured as hierarchies. Additionally
    /// Hierarchies are implied when complex class has other complex classes or datatypes as members. Both of these structures map
    /// cleanly onto the kind of hierarchies that a well formed xml documents provide.
    /// \n \n
    /// There are some relationships in video game objects that cross normal hierarchical boundaries. For example, A constraint
    /// references two actors, and defines a relationship between them. When serialized the constraint simply stores the name of
    /// the actor and looks it up in the actor manager during deserialization. This implies that the actors exist already, or that
    /// there is some mechanism to create the constraint and fill in the actor later. Several mechanisms were discussed to
    /// accomplish this, some include: two passes of processing where constraint would be done in the second pass, a work queue that
    /// would store objects that couldn't be deserialized yet, a prefetcher that would dig through the xml to find the required
    /// object.
    /// \n \n
    /// Those methods all likely could have been made to work. However, they are not optimal for a variety of reasons. All of them
    /// have a set of preconditions and require more computing resources and could potentially delay loading or transmission times.
    /// Some of them heavily imply that all of the items to deserialize must be stored in the same xml source. Some demand access to
    /// xml that may not have been transmitted yet.
    /// \n \n
    /// The simplest, most performant way to work around the issues that cross-hierarchical relationships presented was to ignore
    /// them. More specifically, throw an exception if an object reference during deserialization is not present. Then we ask that
    /// programmers who write code that must store, transmit and reconstruct class instances be aware of the following preconditions
    /// So can produce their own solutions:
    ///     - CollisionShapes must come before Actors and AreaEffects
    ///     - WorldNodes must come before Actors, Light and ParticleEffects. (this is still work in progress).
    ///         - Currently WorldNodes try to find the objects that are attached to them, and the attached tries to find the world node. (if one does not exist, this silently fails)
    ///     - Actors must come before constraints.
    ///     - Actors may have a WorldNode inside them, if this is the case, then the actor must come before Lights and ParticleEffects Attached to it.
    ///     - Actors must be done before SoundSets
    ///     - Sounds must be done before SoundSet (Still in progress)
    ///
    /// The easyiest way to meet these conditions and not consume an inordinate amount of computing resources, is to pay attention
    /// to the order that items are serialized in. If a program serializes the worldnodes, then the actors, then everything else
    /// it will have relatively little trouble making it work.
    /// @subsection serializationintegration Integrate Serialization into Your Code
    /// There several ways to interact with the current serialization system. One might have to create a class that can be
    /// serialized or deserialized. There may be situations where another system is emitting xml and it must be intergrated into
    /// an existing game. It may be desired to create a 'factory' that produces objects from and xml source or create a sink to put
    /// objects into so they can be serialized. Here we will discuss some of the ways that the serialization system can be extended
    /// and what kind of assumptions it makes, so that anyone can write software that interacts with it cleanly.
    /// @subsubsection serializationmaking Make a Serializable or a DeSerializable
    /// Creating a class that be serialized is easy. There is just one function that it must implement. If a class implements this,
    /// it is said to be Serializable:
    /// @code
    /// void SerializableClass::ProtoSerialize(XML::Node&) const;
    /// @endcode
    /// The member ProtoSerialize(XML::Node&) is expected to accept a Mezzanine::XML::Node and attach exactly one Node to it. This new Serialized
    /// node should contain all the data stored in the current state of the object being serialized. Storing data outside of this
    /// one node could cause undefined behavior.
    /// \n \n
    /// The exact layout of the data in the Serialized Node is not pre-determined. The creator of that function need only
    /// take into account any difficulties DeSerializing when creating this. Because of this concern it is advisable name the Serialized
    /// node something unique and appropriate and to include a 'Version' attribute on it. If the class
    /// changes, the DeSerialization function will only need to check the 'Version' attribute to know if and how it can handle it.
    /// \n \n
    /// Integrating with the DeSerialization code is pretty easy too. There are two functions you are expected to implement to
    /// create a DeSerializable:
    /// @code
    /// void DeSerializableClass::ProtoDeSerialize(const XML::Node&);
    /// static String DeSerializableClass::GetSerializableName();
    /// @endcode
    /// The GetSerializableName() is expected to simply return the name of the xml elements this class will DeSerialize. For example
    /// A Mezzanine::Vector3 returns "Vector3", and a Mezzanine::ActorRigid return "ActorRigid". If a class is both DeSerializable and
    /// serializable it makes sense to call this function when assigning the name to the Serialized Node it creates.
    /// \n \n
    /// ProtoDeSerialize(const XML::Node&), accepts a Mezzanine::XML::Node. The Node passed to it would correspond to the Serialized
    /// Node created by the ProtoSerialize(XML::Node&) function listed above. If xml is created by something then this is calling
    /// code is expecting this function to be the correct deserialization function. It is advisable but not required to verify the
    /// name of the xml node matches what is expected and that
    /// the 'Version' is something this code can handle. It is also advisable that every piece of data pulled out is verified the
    /// best it can be. If exceptions are thrown for every discrepency, then programmers using this will create xml and code that
    /// produce no discrepencies.
    /// \n \n
    /// The following template make use of only the 3 functions described above to Serialize or DeSerialize class instances:
    /// @code
    /// template <class T> std::ostream& Serialize(std::ostream& Stream, const T& Converted, const String& Indent = String("") );
    /// template <class T> std::istream& DeSerialize(std::istream& Stream, T& Converted);
    /// @endcode
    /// The functions make calls on the Mezzanine::xml system and expect a fairly basic set of conditions to be met before they are used.
    /// Serialize accepts an output stream and the class instance to be Serialized. It will create an XML::Document and populate it
    /// data from the class provided and then emit that into the stream. DeSerialize accepts an inputstream and the object to be
    /// populated. It expects the next xml element in the stream to be a serialized version of the passed object and will then
    /// overwrite as many of the values of the passed object as possible with the serialized values. For small items DeSerialize
    /// is fine, where possible it is better to have the XML::Document open the file or stream itself as to prevent the second
    /// pass through to find exactly one xml element.
    /// \n \n
    /// @subsubsection serializationserializers Working with Serializers and Deserializers
    /// In some cases, there are some pieces of information that cannot be supplied or
    /// entered by the class itself. This data must be provided by another class or upon creation of the class. This other class
    /// can implement the Serializer, DeSerializer, or both interfaces to make working with large amounts of serialization easier.
    /// \n \n
    /// For example EntityProxy can only accept a mesh upon construction. So overwriting an existing EntityProxy is impossible to do completely.
    /// It expected to be partially implemented, to the extent possible, in the class members. But if you have the need to create
    /// EntityProxys on the fly from data stored in files it makes sense to have a dedicated class or interface than can create these.
    /// Here is what goes into a Serializer:
    /// @code
    /// template <class Serializable> class Serializer
    /// {
    ///     virtual void Serializer::ProtoSerializeAll(XML::Node& CurrentRoot) const = 0;
    ///     virtual std::ostream& Serializer::SerializeAll(std::ostream& Stream) const;
    ///     virtual void Serializer::ProtoSerialize(const Serializable& Target, XML::Node& CurrentRoot) = 0;
    ///     virtual std::ostream& Serializer::Serialize(std::ostream& Stream, const Serializable& Target)
    /// };
    /// @endcode
    /// Serializer::ProtoSerialize() when implement should take the required steps to attach a Serialized Node to the
    /// Passed XML::Node that represent the Serialization target. It is expected to get the extra information that the target
    /// cannot provide from somewhere else. Ideally the the Serializer can be, or be associated with, a manager or container
    /// of some kind. There is not default implementation of this.
    /// \n \n
    /// Serializer::Serialize() Goes one step further than Serializer::ProtoSerialize() and also sends it down a stream. The
    /// default implements use Serializer::ProtoSerialize().
    /// \n \n
    /// Serializer::ProtoSerializeAll() performs a similar role to Serializer::ProtoSerialize(), but again, it goes one step
    /// further. Rather than accept a single Target to serialize it is expected that the Serializer go to the source of the
    /// Targets and serialize all of them that are available. All of the target should be contained in one Node attached to
    /// the Node the function accepts. This is not implemented by default, the logic is too specific to the items to be
    /// serialized.
    /// \n \n
    /// Serializer::SerializeAll() uses Serializer::ProtoSerializeAll() to send all of the available Targets in Serialized
    /// down a stream.
    /// \n \n
    /// The logic behind a DeSerializer is similar to a Serializer. The same types of methods, even similar implementations
    /// if the function is implemented. Like the ProtoDeSerialize() individual DeSerializables implement, the functions on
    /// a DeSerializer will be passed the nodes that would correspond to the those created by their counterparts on the
    /// Serializer. Here is the contents of a Deserializer:
    /// @code
    /// template <class DeSerializable> class DeSerializer
    /// {
    ///     virtual void DeSerializer::ProtoDeSerializeAll(const XML::Node& OneNode) = 0;
    ///     virtual std::istream& DeSerializer::DeSerializeAll(std::istream& Stream)
    ///     virtual DeSerializable* DeSerializer::ProtoDeSerialize(const XML::Node& OneNode) = 0;
    ///     virtual std::istream& DeSerializer::DeSerialize(std::istream& Stream)
    ///     virtual String ContainerName() const = 0;
    /// };
    /// @endcode
    /// The function ContainerName() should be used when creating and verifying the xml element that is parent to the items
    /// DeSerialized by ProtoDeSerializeAll(). The Default implmentation of DeSerializeAll() will use ContainerName to
    /// verify it has extracted the correct Node.
    /// \n \n
    /// There is no technical reason why a class cannot be both a serializer and a deserializer, or even multiple kinds of
    /// Serializers or DeSerializers. To keep things simple the Managers provided by the Mezzanine engine will store a pointer
    /// to the appropriate Serializer when one is required.
    /// @subsubsection serializationlegacy Integrating with External XML Providers
    /// Sometimes yu will be forced to work with a system that produces xml that is not structured in a similar way to this
    /// system. Sometimes it may be too costly or not possible to modify the code to integrate it. For these the following
    /// function exists:
    /// @code
    /// template <class T> void SloppyProtoSerialize(const T& Converted, XML::Node& CurrentRoot)
    /// @endcode
    /// This function will make a call on the the stream insertion operator of the class passed in. If one doesn't exist
    /// it is easy to add one in your code without chaning the original source. If one does exist than you should probably
    /// copy/paste the whole function and re-implement it calling the functions that emit the XML string or stream. If you
    /// want to implement a stream insertion operator, the function prototype should be similar to the stream insertion
    /// operator in the @ref serializationoperators section.
    /// @subsection serializationoperators Serialization Operators
    /// The stream insertion (<<) and stream extraction (>>) operators can be used for serializing and deserializing most items
    /// in the Mezzanine engine.
    ///
    /// Unfortunately due to conflict with the stream insertion operators provided with the iostreams library these couldn't be
    /// made into a template. That doesn't mean that they are difficult to implement. Here is a typical implemenation of stream
    /// insertion operators for XML serialization:
    /// @code
    /// std::ostream& operator << (std::ostream& stream, const Mezzanine::RigidDebris& DebrisToSerialize)
    /// {
    ///     Serialize(stream, DebrisToSerialize);
    ///     return stream;
    /// }
    ///
    /// std::istream& operator >> (std::istream& stream, Mezzanine::RigidDebris& x)
    ///     { return DeSerialize(stream, x); }
    ///
    /// void operator >> (const Mezzanine::XML::Node& OneNode, Mezzanine::RigidDebris& x)
    ///     { x.ProtoDeSerialize(OneNode); }
    ///
    /// @endcode
    /// You will want to implement these functions with the appropriate type. The type Mezzanine::RigidDebris is used purely as example
    /// Though this is actual working code and was in the engine at one point, the current code is more sophiscticated
    /// \n \n
    /// The function operator<< simply calls Serialize and returns the stream, so it has all the pre and cost conditions of the Serialize
    /// function listed in the @ref serializationmaking section.
    /// \n \n
    /// The stream extraction operators are a little bit more interesting. The operator>>(istream,YourType), by virtue of calling Deserialize
    /// will wind up taking two passes over the XML. One looking for the ending tag that matches the first (it gets all the children of that tag too)
    /// and one performing the actual parsing. The operator>>(istream,YourType) will work only with completely parsed objects in memory. With the
    /// combination of these two all the heavy lifting of parsing is done up front, and the rest of the deserialization is just a bunch of pointer
    /// and string manipulation. Another possibility with your stream extraction operator, if you new that it had exactly one parent xml node ,you
    /// create without that first pass for improved performance.
    /// @subsection serializationmisc Other little Things
    /// To simplify and standardize errors thrown, the following functions exist:
    /// @code
    /// void SerializeError(const String& FailedTo, const String& ClassName, Boole SOrD = true);
    /// void DeSerializeError(const String& FailedTo, const String& ClassName, Boole SOrD = false);
    /// @endcode
    /// Both of these functions throw a Mezzanine::Exception with the descriptive text of "Could not {FailedTo} during {ClassName} [De]Serialization."
    /// If SOrD (Serialize Or Deserialize) is true the "De" is not printed.
